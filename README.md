# Homework-1
These are the things I changed to refactor the code:

1. Changed the div elements to semantic elements such as header, nav, main, section, and aside
2. Added figure element for the image
3. Deleted some unnecessary classes
4. Changed the targeted classes on CSS to the elements
5. Orginized CSS elements from general to specific
